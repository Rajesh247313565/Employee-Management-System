Installation
Backend Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd EMS/backend


Build the project:

mvn clean install


Run the Spring Boot backend:

mvn spring-boot:run


Backend will run on: http://localhost:8080

Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend folder:

cd EMS/frontend


Install dependencies:

npm install


Start the React app:

npm start


Frontend will run on: http://localhost:3000

Database Setup

Create a MySQL database (e.g., ems_db).

Update the backend application.properties file with your database credentials:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ems_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update


The database tables will be created automatically using JPA.
